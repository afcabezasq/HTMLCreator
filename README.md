You can review the HTML messages with a chrome browser, to save you changes you can do `ctrl+s` and select a folder where you want to save the reviewed documents

To convert back from the HTML make sure all the reviewed documents are stored in a unified folder. Then you can search those folders using the `Browse HTML files folder` button in the app.

This will generate 2 folders:
- reviewed_data: Stores the html contents by day in a csv format
- compiled_data: Stores all the html contents in csv format
